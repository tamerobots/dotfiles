# Dotfiles

This is a repository for my Linux config files. 
These dotfiles are mine and you should not install them yourself - but feel free to copy any bits you find useful.

### Installing ###
Install by git cloning the repository into your home directory, then running /dotfiles/install-dotfiles.sh (Read the contents of the script first, you shouldn't just trust random shell scripts you find on the internet!)

install-dotfiles.sh just backs up any relevant dotfiles you may already have in your home directory to a new directory 'dotfiles_old', and then replaces the originals in the home directory with symlinks to those in /dotfiles/.
