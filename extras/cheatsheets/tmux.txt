your machine and restore a session. all sessions are wiped on power off.

tmux new -s mysession         start a new tmux session called mysession
tmux a -t mysession           reopen a tmux session you just closed
tmux ls                       list all tmux sessions
ctrl+b "                      split vertically
ctrl+b %                      split horizontally
ctrl+b o                      move through the panes
ctrl+b x                      kill the current pane
ctrl+b :detach                detach current session (logout, but keep it)
