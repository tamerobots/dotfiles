=============== Tmux ======================
Remember, tmux is capable of *persistent* sessions too.
tmux                          start a new tmux session
tmux new -s mysession         start a new tmux session called mysession
tmux a -t mysession           when you come back next day, re log into it
tmux ls                       list all tmux sessions
ctrl+b "                      split vertically
ctrl+b %                      split horizontally
ctrl+b o                      move through the panes
ctrl+b x                      kill the current pane
ctrl+b :detach                detach current session (logout, but keep it)
tmux kill-session             kills current session (kill it forever)
